  <p>Wok is a static website generator. It turns a pile of templates,
content, and resources (like CSS and images) into a neat stack of plain
HTML. You run it on your local computer, and it generates a directory of
web files that you can upload to your web server, or serve directly.</p>
<p>The idea is that you don't need a big server-side engine like Drupal or
Django to generate every page, every visit, for every visitor. Caching
helps, but it can only do so much. Instead, you can generate the entire
site once ahead of time, and only regenerate things when something has
changed. A good way this could be done would be with a post-commit hook
on a git repository containing your content or layout.</p>
<p>Wok is similar in concept to other static site generators, like
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde">Hyde</a>, and <a href="http://static.newqdev.com/">Static</a>, but different in a few ways, like
a page/subpage category system, and a restricted focus of features. For
example, instead of providing tools to generate RSS feeds directly, the
tools that are needed to build a generic XML document are provided.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Content and presentation are separated.</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, and plain text renders.</li>
<li><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org">Jinja2</a> based templating system.</li>
<li>Optional: Syntax highlighting via <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a></li>
<li>Tagging and a hierarchical category system.</li>
<li>Simple development server, for testing.</li>
<li>Support for pagination.</li>
</ul>
<p>And more to come. Some features that are cooking in the devs' heads are
custom python plugins, once per page hooks, and support for more markup
languages.</p>
