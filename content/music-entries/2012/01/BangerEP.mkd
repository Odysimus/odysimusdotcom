It's winter time. I am not usually a fan of Skrillex, but for some reason this EP by him is really doing the trick. It focuses less on the 'Shock and Awe' feeling that some of his music has and instead has some really good vocal samples and a more melodic feeling throughout. Have a listen. What do you think?
