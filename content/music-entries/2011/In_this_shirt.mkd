Royksopp is band that consistently makes really great music. Some of their tracks are real [gems][remind_me]. _Melody A.M._ is my favorite album from them. It [has][in_space] some [really][leno] good [stuff][so_easy]. Whenever I meet someone who likes this band I know they are cool.

They released two songs over the summer (one is a remix), both of which are more than 13 minutes long.
