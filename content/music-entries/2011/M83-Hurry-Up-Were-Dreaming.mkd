Nearly a month later I'm actually doing this. Anthony Gonzales (more [evidence][m83] to add to my French musician theory) is a genius.

It started with the first time I heard *Hurry Up We're Dreaming* all the way though, from start to finish; I found it to be alright but it really didn't impress me. A day later I did the same thing, all the way through. I still didn't find it amazing. Then I started listening to the album. Not as background noise, but simply lying down, just... listening. It was
growing on me. Only after I _truly_ listened could I appreciate the complexity and thought that Gonzales put into his work. I think I have listened to the album (22 tracks, it's a 2 disk album) at least 7 times. I always find myself wanting to try and listen to it completely. Such massive replay value.

This won't do it justice, but here are a few tracks.

Context makes all the difference. Sit down and listen... if you have the time.
