The Teddybears! So, the first time I heard this band I was 16? I can't remember how, but I ended up with a CD from my friend Bryan. Along with teenage emo bands there was [this track][yours_to_keep] hidden halfway through the track list. Little did I know that years later, while high on opiates (It was for my back, I swear), I would _truely_ discover the Teaddybears while listening to the complete album _Rock and Roll Highschool_ (pun probably intended).

Some of their older work includes [this][punk] and [this][cobra_style].

They have some new stuff out.
