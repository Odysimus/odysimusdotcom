FIFA!!! That video game always has a great sound track. I Googled "fifa '12 soundtrack" and found a page where EA was asking the hive mind (a.k.a the Internet) to suggest songs for FIFA '12. Here are some of the better suggestions I found.

I've never heard these guys before.

The [music video][jam] is pretty entertaining.

This one, like the comment suggested, belongs in Fifa '12.
