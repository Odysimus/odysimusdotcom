I've been listening to Kanye West and Jay-Z's new collaboration album for the last few days. It's alright (I am very strongly holding back a rant about both of their more recent musical works). I thought I'd just share some older stuff by other artists.

This is <u>Something's Got A Hold On Me</u> by <u>Etta James</u>

A little while ago a band called <u>Pretty Lights</u> released this track, sampling James' work.

_(I've never been able to get into Pretty Lights. Maybe I've just been listenting to the wrong stuff. Send me your favorite track by them!)_

In early May 2011 <u>Avicii</u> realesed this remix.

I was really fond of this track when I first heard it. It was "one of those tracks". I pretty much played it over and over again, but thankfully I can still <strike>tollerate</strike> enjoy listening to it.
